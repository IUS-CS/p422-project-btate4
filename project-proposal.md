I do not know markdown at the moment :) 

Project Proposal
Brandon Tate
P422 - Web Enterprise Systems



I plan on making a Web Application of selling products of some sort. In this specific example, I plan on selling just clothes. Plan on making an user interface to implement data(supplies) into a database. I plan on making a product screen that will loop through all the supplies. I think i want to make profiles as well so I can make a log in screen and a profile screen to be able to store user's information for a quick checkout. Something I want to look into doing is how to encrypt passwords and credit card numbers if I can figure out how to safely store them. I don't know what a website name or company name will be called. This is all I currently have at this moment.
